# Demo 01

Using MySQL from Python with a **Database First** methodology.
I'm using the Repository pattern as described in one of the earlier classes.

It still works with FastAPI, REST, GraphQL and Docker.
You can use the `new_book.json` to insert a new book into the database.

The project itself works with `Poetry` as a package manager, and Docker to launch our database.
